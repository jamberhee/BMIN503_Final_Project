# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This repository contains Amber Rhee's final code and written report, looking at associations between communication difficulty and high impact pain in U.S. adults in 2023. It utilizes data from the 2023 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), Sample Adult Interview. All analyses are completed in the R package survey in order to account for NHIS' complex survey design.

-   **final_project_template.qmd** provides the original R code for the analysis and visualizations.

-   **final_project_template.html** provides all the code, comments, and visualizations rendered in an HTML output.

The original NHIS data set can be downloaded from this [link](https://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Datasets/NHIS/2023/adult23csv.zip).
